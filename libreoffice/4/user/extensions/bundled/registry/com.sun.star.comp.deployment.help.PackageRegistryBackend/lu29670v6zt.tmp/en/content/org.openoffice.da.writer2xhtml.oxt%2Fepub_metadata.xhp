The EPUB standard specifies a large number of document properties.
        Not all of these are supported by the OpenDocument standard.
        Writer2xhtml supports the additional properties using user defined document properties.
        This dialog provides a convenient interface to edit all EPUB document properties, but you can also access all properties
        using the standard interface in %PRODUCTNAME Writer, that is File - Properties.
        Writer2xhtml will always include the identifier, author(s), date(s) and the title.
        Other fields are optional and can be left blank. In this case they will not be included in the EPUB document.
Custom identifier
Each EPUB document must have a unique identifier.
        Normally Writer2xhtml generates a Universal Unique ID (UUID) for this purpose, but you may override this with
        your own identifier.
Use custom identifier
Check this if you want to provide your own identifier
Identifier
Enter the identifier to use. Remember that it must be unique amongst all
        EPUB documents.
Identifier type
An identifier may follow a specific identification scheme, e.g. ISBN.
   		Select or enter an identification scheme in this field.
Authors
An EPUB document can have several authors, which you can list here.
		An author can be either a creator, that is a primary author of the publication, or a contributor,
		that is a party whose contribution to the publication is secondary to the creator(s).
		Furthermore an author may have a special role, e.g. illustrator. Both properties are specified when you add
		a new author to the list.
Note that some EPUB readers may only present the first creator, hence
		you should make sure that the primary creator is at the top of the list.
If you do not add any authors, Writer2xhtml will display and use a default value
		for the author.

Dates

If you do not add any dates, Writer2xhtml will display and use a default value
